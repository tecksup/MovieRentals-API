A few comments:
2) Use Lombok
3) I see no usage of Dependency Injection

For some extra challenges that will help you learn a bit more:
1) Extract all normal logic from the Controller: it should be the Service layer that takes care of that.
2) Normal logic assumes all inputs are correct: use javax.constraints (@Validated) to take care of that
3) Use @ControllerAdvice for controlling the error handling separately from this all
4) Understand how you can use application.properties, along with Spring Profiles, to control the flow of your application: you should have a local and a prod profile.
5) For each profile, you want to use a different database: first, the local profile should connect to an H2 (in-memory) database, and then prod should instead connect to a PosgreSQL database that you would run locally (it would actually be in the cloud or whatever, but for the purpose of this exercise we'll just make sure you can connect to 2 different DBs using profiles configuration)
6) Use Hibernate along with Spring Data to set up @Repository classes that would manage the connection and SQL calls to the DBs.
7) Those repositories should be injected in the service layers. The Controller should never see the repositories.
8) Create a few test classes that use Jupiter for setting up the scenarios (@BeforeEach) and making some assertions (Assertions.asserTrue(...)). Those tests should use their own H2 DB. You can simply make those integration tests (so go ahead and use @SpringBootTest, which will load the entire context for you).
9) Create some unit tests for any specific class you want using Mockito.

Now, to orient your efforts, let me propose something rather simple because all the points I just mentioned will represent plenty of challenges for you: a simple movie-rental API. (Thus you don't need to make a frontend for it. Just use Postman to interact with it.)
The API should follow RESTful best practices and should support the following operations: GET, DELETE, and POST. Your entities will be: Movie, Reservation.
Ideally we should be able to :
1) See how many movies are available
2) See how many movies have been reserved
3) Create a reservation
4) Delete a reservation
And you can forget about security/authentication for now.
Technically, you'd have the whole DTO + DAO + ObjectMapper for each entity, but that'd just be annoying: you'll already have plenty of work there.
Those are all things that are (usually) in the day-to-day life of a REST API developer that uses Spring. :man_shrugging: 
Some of the tech stack was arbitrarily chosen, but they are for the most part the most popular choices so it won't be wasted effort to have learned them.
